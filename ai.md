now: 

1) try to go analysis on ../hqcoffee, and write analysis report here in referrences folder, to list out the classes relationships in base tools and usecase (cases folder, self.coffee or self.coffee), 

2) try to use the nodejs/javascript packages it uses within Swift, to create a Swift translate of it, as a Swift package using SwiftPM, 

-a document a plan with detailed comparison on several possible approaches 
-b build functioning level equal and coding level close implementation in Swift for all those base tools and utilities coffeescript classes, which will enable read/write excel files and generate pptx files, and read and write stormdb
-c build similiar sample app using this package to enable creating data analysis reports, just like the ../hqcoffee/cases/*/self.coffee or testSelf.coffee (they are the samething) does as usecase samples / examples, which must can read from and write to excel files, and generate pptx
